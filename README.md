# Aggregation-Network-Diffusion
Code for implementing the Aggregation-Network diffusion model (AND), as described in the paper: 

Code for the Aggregation-Network Diffusion (AND) model of pathology ramification in human brain connectome. 

Please cite the paper as follows:
Combined Model of Aggregation And Network Diffusion Recapitulates Alzheimerâ€™s Regional Tau-PET 
Ashish Raj*, Veronica Tora, Xiao Gao, Hanna Cho, Jae Yong Choi, Young Hoon Ryu, Chul Hyoung Lyoo, Bruno Franchi
*Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California at San Francisco

This version contains code that can do both tau and Abeta
For now we are enabling only dynamics of tau, no Ab (will add later for paper 2)
This code will reproduce the results of the fully realised Franchi-Raj AND model
We are posting group regional atrophy and tau SUVr tables for use in this code, however we are unable to post individual subject data

Important: Please add all subfolders within this folder to matlab path prior to running this code
